# Anuja Jayasinghe's Portfolio

My personal portfolio site — [anujajay.com](https://anujajay.com). Built with Next.js 16, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

This is a personal asset, not a template for others to clone and run — this README documents how the site is built and what's notable about it, for future reference.

## ✨ Highlights

- **Data-driven, not hardcoded** - Projects (`src/data/projects.json`) and certificates (`src/data/certificates.json`) are stored as structured data and rendered by components, so adding a project or cert doesn't touch layout code.
- **Live GitHub contribution graph** - `src/lib/github-contributions.ts` queries the GitHub GraphQL API for real contribution data server-side, cached for an hour, and rendered as an interactive timeline (`GitHubTimelineServer.tsx` → `GitHubTimeline.tsx`).
- **`/cv` and `/resume` shortcuts** - Both permanently redirect straight to the CV PDF, via Next.js's built-in `redirects()` config (`next.config.ts`), so anyone can jump to my resume without hunting for a link.
- **Splash screen + smooth animations** - Framer Motion powers the entry animation and interactions throughout.
- **Fully responsive** - Mobile-friendly navbar, layout, and sections.
- **Dark-themed design** - Modern, professional dark UI end to end.
- **Vercel Analytics & Speed Insights** built in for real usage/performance data.
